Report for project 2
**********************************************************************
1. In this project, my program implement the concurrency of three kinds of threads: immigrant, spectator and judge with the use of semaphores to meet the requirement of constraints.

2. The program run in an infinite loop without starvation.

3. The program can exit gracefully.

4. About the starvation of the program:
According to the description of the project, there will be one starvation if the judge enters before any of the immigrants enter.
My solution to the problem is add a semapore imm_enter such that if no immgrant has entered, the judge cannot enter. Additionally, the semaphore imm_enter should be decreased when the immigrant leave.
